# auralib
Python package to support investigation of geoscience problems including 
geophysics, rock physics, petrophysics, and data read/write in common formats.

This is a collection of classes and functions that have various levels of 
maturity and have been built as-needed to solve technical problems in a 
production geoscience environment.  Some things will work better than others.
